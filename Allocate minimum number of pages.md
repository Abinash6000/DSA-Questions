/*
Q -> I have a doubt why is there no condition for students <k?? Even this condition should return false right?

Ans -> â€‹Actually this condition should return "true" because if students < k that means we have distributed some extra books to a particular student, in that case we can take the extra book from that particular student and give it to a new student until the condition becomes students == k.

This condition is already handled in isValid() function when we return true at the end of function.
For example:- consider the following testcase:
n = 7 array = 15 10 19 10 5 18 7 k = 5

distribution for max = 25: [[15, 10], [19], [10, 5], [18, 7]] : no. of students == 4. But, we can easily take one book from a student and give it to a new student which will give us a no. of students == 5. In this case the function will return true.
Thank You.

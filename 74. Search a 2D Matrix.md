# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int m = matrix.length, n = matrix[0].length;
        int low = 0, high = m*n-1;

        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;

            if(matrix[mid/n][mid%n] == target) return true;
            else if(matrix[mid/n][mid%n] > target) high = mid-1;
            else low = mid+1;
        }

        return false;
    }
}

/* 
Why mid/n == currRow && mid%n == currCol ???
where, n == no. of columns
(mid/n)
lets say mid == 6, and columns are 4, when 6 will be divided b/w all 4 columns we would've counted the no. of rows to be 1. 
(mid%n)
lets say mid == 6, and columns are 4, mid is the 6th element in a normal array, but in a matrix the column number will be 2 and (6 != 2). So, if I divide 6 between 4 columns the remider left will be 2, which is my current column.
